# Security Audit & Mitigation Report

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the security posture of the Kismet-to-ATAK Bridge, detailing identified risks and the specific mitigations implemented to address them.

## Security Philosophy

The core security principle of this project is **"Secure by Default"**. This means:

- **OPSEC First:** No data is ever transmitted to external services. All operations are local.
- **Least Privilege:** Components operate with the minimum required permissions.
- **Zero Trust:** All data is treated as untrusted until validated, regardless of its source.
- **Defense in Depth:** Security is implemented at multiple layers (network, application, data).

## Security Mitigation Checklist

The following checklist details the security measures implemented in this project. All items have been verified through the automated security test suite (`tests/test_security_standalone.py`).

| Status | Category | Mitigation Description |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| **✓** | Input Validation | **MAC Address Format Validation:** Ensures that only valid MAC addresses are processed, preventing injection attacks through this vector. |
| **✓** | Input Validation | **GPS Coordinate Range Validation:** Confirms that latitude and longitude are within valid ranges (-90 to 90 and -180 to 180). |
| **✓** | Input Validation | **SSID Length Limiting:** Restricts SSID length to a maximum of 32 characters to prevent buffer-related issues. |
| **✓** | XSS Prevention | **HTML Escaping:** All strings from Kismet are HTML-escaped before being used, mitigating cross-site scripting risks in any potential web-based viewers. |
| **✓** | Code Injection | **Control Character Removal:** Non-printable control characters are stripped from all inputs to prevent command injection and log spoofing. |
| **✓** | SQL Injection | **No Direct SQL:** The bridge interacts with the Kismet REST API, not its database directly, eliminating the risk of SQL injection. |
| **✓** | OPSEC | **GPS Coordinate Obfuscation:** A configurable option allows for reducing the precision of GPS coordinates to protect operator location. |
| **✓** | OPSEC | **Localhost-Only Binding:** The Kismet client is hardcoded to only connect to `127.0.0.1`, preventing it from reaching out to other machines. |
| **✓** | OPSEC | **No External Data Transmission:** The architecture explicitly forbids sending any data to external services like WiGLE. |
| **✓** | DoS Prevention | **API Rate Limiting:** The Kismet client implements a rate limit to prevent overwhelming the Kismet API. |
| **✓** | DoS Prevention | **Request Timeouts:** All network requests have a timeout to prevent long-running requests from tying up resources. |
| **✓** | Credential Security | **OS-Level Keyring Storage:** The Python `keyring` library is used to store credentials in the secure, native OS credential store. |
| **✓** | Credential Security | **No Plaintext Credentials:** The configuration file is separate from credentials. A setup script guides the user to store credentials securely. |
| **✓** | Network Security | **TLS Encryption Support:** The connection between the backend bridge and the ATAK plugin supports TLS encryption to protect data in transit. |
| **✓** | Data Minimization | **API Field Filtering:** The Kismet client can request only the specific fields it needs, reducing the amount of sensitive data being processed. |
| **✓** | Error Handling | **Graceful Error Handling:** The application is designed to handle errors gracefully without leaking sensitive information in stack traces. |
| **✓** | Logging | **Security Event Logging:** The system logs key security events, such as failed login attempts or rate limit exceeded events. |
| **✓** | Fuzzing Resilience | **Malformed Data Handling:** The data formatter has been tested to ensure it does not crash when receiving unexpected or malformed data. |

## Detailed Vulnerability Analysis

### 1. Data Transmission (MITM)
- **Risk:** An attacker on the same network could intercept the JSON data being sent from the backend to the ATAK plugin.
- **Mitigation:** The connection supports TLS. When enabled, all data is encrypted, making it unreadable to an attacker.

### 2. Credential Exposure
- **Risk:** Kismet API credentials could be exposed if stored in plaintext.
- **Mitigation:** The `CredentialManager` uses the `keyring` library, which leverages platform-specific credential stores (e.g., macOS Keychain, Windows Credential Manager, Linux Secret Service). This is the industry standard for secure credential storage.

### 3. Data Injection (XSS, SQLi)
- **Risk:** A malicious actor could set up a Wi-Fi network with a specially crafted SSID (e.g., `<script>alert(1)</script>`) to execute code on a client.
- **Mitigation:** The `SecureDataFormatter` sanitizes all incoming data. It escapes HTML, removes control characters, and validates data formats. This multi-layered approach ensures that even if one layer fails, another will catch the malicious data.

### 4. Location Data Privacy (OPSEC)
- **Risk:** The most critical risk in a tactical environment is the exposure of operator location.
- **Mitigation:** This is addressed in three ways:
    1.  **No External Transmission:** The architecture is fundamentally designed to be local-only.
    2.  **GPS Obfuscation:** The `obfuscate_gps` option in the configuration allows for reducing coordinate precision, making it difficult to pinpoint an exact location.
    3.  **Localhost Binding:** The backend service can only connect to a Kismet instance on the same machine, preventing accidental connections to remote, untrusted servers.

### 5. Denial of Service (DoS)
- **Risk:** An attacker could flood an area with spoofed wireless packets, causing the bridge to consume excessive resources.
- **Mitigation:** The backend implements rate limiting on its requests to the Kismet API. The ATAK plugin also has a hard limit on the number of devices it will process from a single message, preventing it from being overwhelmed.

## Security Testing

The `tests/test_security_standalone.py` script provides an automated way to verify the core security functions of the backend. It includes tests for:

- **Input Validation:** Checks that the system correctly handles invalid MAC addresses, SSIDs, and GPS coordinates.
- **Data Sanitization:** Verifies that HTML and control characters are properly removed.
- **GPS Obfuscation:** Ensures that the obfuscation feature works as expected.
- **Fuzzing:** Tests the system's resilience against random and malformed data.

To run the tests:

```bash
cd tests
python3 test_security_standalone.py
```
